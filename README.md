# A Notebook For Investigating and Creating Baseline Models For The King-Country Housing Dataset

This is a  notebook that utilizes basic machine learning and in-depth data exploration techniques to explore and create baseline models for, the dataset/competition *'House Sales in King-County'*. <br>The following is the information from Kaggle:<br><br>

```
This dataset contains house sale prices for King County, which includes Seattle. 
It includes homes sold between May 2014 and May 2015.
```

## Getting Started

```
1. Clone this repository
2. Create an environment (and activate it) and install the requirements.txt file
3. Download the dataset from - https://raw.githubusercontent.com/darien-schettler/king-county-house-price-eda-and-model/master/kc_house_data.csv
4. Alternatively you can launch a google colab and perform the !wget operation on the link from the previous step to get the data
5. Launch jupyter/colab
6. Open the file from the cloned repositry (or !wget)
7. Enjoy
```

## Deployment

To deploy this on a system and leave it running, you will need to attach the jupyter instance to a seperate 'screen' in the terminal/cmd prompt. There are different ways of doing this but you should be able to find the appropriate documentation easily. <br>
As this is a learning tool, there is no further information regarding deployment via docker, etc.
